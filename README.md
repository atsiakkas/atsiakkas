I am Antreas, I am currently working as an Actuarial Consultant in the exciting area of Pensions. I hold a MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh and a BSc in Actuarial Science from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. 

My interests extend beyond the actuarial area to topics such as :robot: machine learning, :chains: blockchain technology and :floppy_disk: big data. If you want to learn more, don't hesitate to contact me.
