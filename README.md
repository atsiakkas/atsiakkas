# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ˜„ About me

I am currently working as an Actuarial Consultant in the exciting area of Pensions. I hold a MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh and a BSc in Actuarial Science from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. 

My interests extend beyond the actuarial area to topics such as :robot: machine learning, :chains: blockchain technology and :floppy_disk: big data. If you want to learn more, don't hesitate to contact me.

### Reinforcement Learning with Non-Conventional Value Function Approximation Methods

This project constituted my MSc thesis and involved the implementation and empirical evaluation of different non-conventional value function approximation methods in the Reinforcement Learning context. Implemented methods include Decision Tree, Support Vector Regression, k-Nearest Neighbours and Gaussian Processes -based methods.
